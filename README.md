# Toggle Function Keys

A simple AppleScript that toggles the `”Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"` setting found under `System Preferences > Keyboard`. Displays a message to Notification Center telling you wich one is active.

I use this script via Alfred with an assigned keyword. Toggling between the two modes is really easy.

Note that you have to have `”Enable access for assistive devices”` turned on.
